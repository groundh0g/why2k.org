Joseph Hall has been a professional software developer for nearly 25 years. He worked as a programmer for Microsoft and IBM, and he was the software architect for a Fortune 500 bank before starting his own consulting company in 2006. Joe makes his living writing desktop, web, and mobile device applications for businesses and governmental agencies, but game programming is his passion, and it was gaming that got him into programming in the first place.

Joe was a member of the original Xbox team and he joined the Visual Studio .NET team just after the Xbox was released in 2001. He is the author of *XNA Game Studio Express: Developing Games for Windows and the Xbox 360*, which was published in 2007. In this new series of books Joe applies his unique blend of development experiences to help you explore the exciting arena of cross-platform game development using Xamarin Studio and MonoGame.

Joe lives with his wife of 21 years and his three daughters in Montgomery, Alabama. Every summer, Joe teaches high school students how to write games during an intense weeklong course in North Carolina for Landry Academy. In his free time, Joe dabbles in sketching, cartooning, and creating 3D models. When you see [his artistic creations](http://groundh0g.deviantart.com/), you'll understand why he makes his living as a programmer.

> **UPDATE:** On March 23rd, 2015, Joe begins his next, great adventure by joining [ThoughtWorks.com](http://www.thoughtworks.com/), a leader in agile methodology and test-driven development. Woot!
