# 2016 Scholarship Rules

I'm sure there will be questions about the scholarships and how they're awarded. I probably won't address them all here, but I'll try.

## Requirements

1. Students must have completed the 7th grade or be 13 years old (or older).
1. Students may have completed the 12th grade, but must be 19 years old (or younger).
1. Students must bring a laptop on which they have administrative rights. (In rare / limited cases, a loaner laptop may be provided.)
1. Students must provide for their own travel. Lodging and all meals for the week-long camp are provided.

Additionally, students must apply using the survey at [https://codetopia.typeform.com/to/GJfYNC](https://codetopia.typeform.com/to/GJfYNC). I will not accept applications via other methods, e.g. direct messages or emails.

## Dates

The summer camp website can be found on [landryacademy.com](http://landryacademy.com/families1/camps/nc/).

The dates for the game programming camp are June 12 - 18, 2016. Obviously, we will need to make a selection before that so that the winners can make room on their calendars and plan their travel.

[Applications](https://codetopia.typeform.com/to/GJfYNC) must be submitted by the end of day, Friday, April 1st. (Nope. That's not a joke.)

We will select the students over the weekend, and announce the winners on Tuesday, April 5th. Winners will be notified via email.

> **NOTE:** If we haven't been able to make contact with a winner within two weeks (Tuesday, April 19th), we will select a replacement. So be sure to enter your contact information (your email address) correctly when filling out the application.

## Judging

1. Scholarships are awarded at the sole discretion of [Joseph Hall](http://why2k.org/about.html) and his coworker, Ryanne B.
1. Our decision is primarily based on the response to the following survey questions:
  * Why do you want to attend the camp?
  * Have your parent or guardian tell me a little about you.
  * Is there anything else you'd like me to consider?
1. These scholarships are only available to female students who meet the requirements, listed earlier.
1. In the (very unlikely) event that two candidates are judged to have exactly equal merit, preference will be given to:
  * Ethnicity - minorities are also underrepresented in Computer Science.
  * Follow-up questions, if we are still unable to make a clear distinction between the applicants.

## Who's Paying for This?

Right now, it's just me (thanks to the blessings of my wife). I intend to pester a few companies for give-aways (swag, software licenses, etc.) or to help sponsor more students. But at this time, the scope of what I can do is limited by my ability to pay out-of-pocket. I have worked out a deal with the founder of the camps that allows me to forgo my pay for those students and to pay for the students' room and board. It's much cheaper than paying the tuition outright, but my resources are limited.

## Why the Preference to Female Students?

Honestly, if I weren't a father of three girls, I likely would be just as oblivious and apathetic to the lack of female computer scientists as most folks. But the statistics are a driving motivator for me.

## How Can I Help?

A free way to support this project is to just share the word! Paste the link for [Why2K.org](http://why2k.org/) to Facebook, Twitter, Email, or wherever you normally spend your time on social media. If you're so inclined, I'd also appreciate a follow [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/groundh0g) or a like [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Fauxcabulary/).

Thanks!
