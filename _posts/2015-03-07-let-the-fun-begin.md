Phew! It's finally done! 

The site at [Why2K.org](http://why2k.org/) is live!

Inhale that new website smell.

I appreciate you taking the time to look at my little experiment. If it's going to be a success, it will be because of you. I need your tweets and posts to generate buzz around two of my hobby projects. Both books, this time.

Click the link above to see what the fuss is all about and help me spread the word.
