### Update

The site at [Why2K.org](http://why2k.org/) is still live!

I've taken the Fauxcabulary book off the table by completing it last month. I was able to generate a book with just under 470 pages by writing a program to scrape my existing and future posts.

You can buy (or sample) the eBook at [LeanPub.com](https://leanpub.com/fauxcabulary), or buy a paperback version from [Lulu.com](http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/joseph-hall/fauxcabulary/paperback/product-22179468.html).

Thanks for your support! I'll be focusing more time on the MonoGame book(s) now.
