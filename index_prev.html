    <p>The short version of all this is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I'm working on a new game programming book, <a href="http://codetopia.com/book/codecamps/" target="_blank"><i>MonoGame: Code Camps</i></a>.</li>
        <li>I'm still teaching my <a href="http://codetopia.com/camps/" target="_blank">annual summer camp on game programming</a>.</li>
        <li>I'll be offering scholarships to two young ladies for the camp. Room, board, and tuition included. Travel (to Banner Elk, NC) not included.</li>
        <li>ETA for accepting applications is January, 2016. Details will be posted here.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><p>I discussed this topic with my wife. We've decided to sponsor two girls each year for the camp I teach. So, Why2K.org now means "Why $2,000?" The answer to that question is that it's roughly the cost to me for sending two young ladies to the <a href="http://codetopia.com/camps/" target="_blank">game programming camp</a>.</p></blockquote>

    <h3>#Why2K, Repurposed.</h3>

    <p>The original intent of <a href="http://why2k.org/">Why2K.org</a> was to boost my follower counts on <a href="https://twitter.com/groundh0g" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, my likes on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Fauxcabulary/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and my fragile ego in real life. I had hoped to reach 2,000 followers on each service. That may sound ambitious, but I have friends with 10,000+ followers. Why2K.org was a catchy domain, so I randomly selected that as my goal.</p>

    <p>The idea was simple. Total strangers would dictate what I worked on, using their likes and follows. Follow me on twitter and I would work on my new game programming book. Like my Fauxcabulary facebook page and I would work on my pun dictionary.</p>

    <p>I took the Fauxcabulary book off the table by completing it earlier this year. I was able to generate a book with just under 470 pages by writing a program to scrape my existing and future pun-a-day blog posts. You can buy (or sample) the eBook at <a href="https://leanpub.com/fauxcabulary" target="_blank">LeanPub.com</a>, or buy a paperback version from <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/joseph-hall/fauxcabulary/paperback/product-22179468.html" target="_blank">Lulu.com</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm currently focusing the lion's share of my "free time" on the new <a href="http://codetopia.com/book/codecamps/ target="_blank"">MonoGame book</a> for my summer <a href="http://codetopia.com/camps/index.html" target="_blank">game programming camps</a>. Even though I didn't meet my goal of gaining 2,000 followers on Twitter or Facebook, I <a href="https://twitter.com/groundh0g/status/634589308335210497" target="_blank">made the decision</a> to open the process of writing the new game programming book up for public scrutiny.</p>

    <blockquote><p><i>Technically, I'm working on two books if you count <a href="https://leanpub.com/revolution2dot5" target="_blank">my stalled novel</a>.<br/>Download the first 17 or so sample chapters if you need an effective, drug-free sleep aid.</i></p></blockquote>

    <p>So, without competing projects to drive the voting, what's the point of Why2K.org now? I'm glad you asked!</p>

    <h3>Girl Power!</h3>

    <p>The first summer of teaching the game programming camp, in 2011, brought five students -- all male. Honestly, that was the demographic I expected.</p>

    <p>I have three daughters, all of which I hope will follow in daddy's footsteps and take an interest in the varied aspects of game design and development. So, you can imagine my excitement when there was a girl in the next summer's group, in 2012. Every year since, there's been at least one female game-developer-to-be in every camp. In fact, as the camp has grown (to 15 students in 2015!), the ratio of female students has remained around 1-in-5.</p>

    <p>That number may seem low, but it's actually in line with the statistics for female Computer Science majors. But, when you consider that more than half of registered undergrads are female, that number seems even more anemic.</p>

    <p><img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/img/stats/female-gamedev-stats.png" /></p>

    <p>I get it. Computer Science isn't for everyone. It's considered a nerdy field of study. But, females make up half of the Math and Science majors! And half of the gamers in the world are female.</p>

    <p>While it may have been true that female gamers were in the minority in the early years of gaming, more current surveys show that ratio of girl-to-boy gamers is getting closer and closer to 1-to-1. When you factor in mobile gaming, casual games, and the age ranges of the players, female gamers actually outnumber their male counterparts in some surveys.</p>

    <h3>So? What Can You Do About It?</h3>

    <p>I discussed this topic with my wife. We've decided to sponsor two girls each year for the camp I teach. So, Why2K.org now means "Why $2,000?" The answer to that question is that it's roughly the cost to me for sending two young ladies to the <a href="http://codetopia.com/camps/" target="_blank">game programming camp</a>.</p>

    <p>I worked out a deal with the director of the camps, Greg Landry, where I forgo my pay for those students and I pay the students' room and board for the week. Add to that the cost of two new laptops, and my net cost is roughly $2K for two campers. Factor in the fact that I have two teenage girls who attend the camp and each summer is a net loss for me.</p>

    <h3>How Can I Help?</h3>

    <p>Honestly, I'm not in the begging mode just yet. I'm more than willing to put my own money and time where my heart is. If you want to show support, I'd appreciate a <a href="https://twitter.com/groundh0g" target="_blank">follow on twitter</a> or a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Fauxcabulary" target="_blank">like on facebook</a>.</p>

    <p>Feel free to share a link to the <a href="http://codetopia.com/book/codecamps/" target="_blank">new game programming book-in-progress</a>, too. The more folks that are watching (and waiting), the more likely I am to be shamed into making continuous progress on the project.</p>

    <h3>How Can My Kid Qualify for the Scholarship?</h3>

    <p>The next camp is in June, 2016. My research tells me that folks get serious about looking / applying for similar opportunities around the beginning of the year. So, near the end of 2015, I'll create and share the guidelines for applying and qualifying.</p>

    <p>I know there will be a short essay component - for the student and the parent. I'd like to make the program needs-based as well, but I don't know how easily I could verify the financial status of applicant families. The essay is easier. And less prone to fraud.</p>

    <h3>Why Only Girls?</h3>

    <p>See the infographic I posted earlier. I don't have a shortage of male students. In fact, statistically speaking, I don't really have a shortage of female students either. As a father of three girls, I'd just like to see that girl-to-boy ratio rise a good bit.</p>

    <p>If this experiment works out, and I feel like the students and I are getting something out of it, I'll try to expand the scope to be more inclusive. At that point, though, I'll probably be looking to have partners (via a fund-me site or a corporate sponsor).</p>

    <h3>So, What Do You Get Out Of It?</h3>

    <p>With respect to the new book, I get a little direction. I get a little motivation. Plus, I don't have to work in a vacuum.</p>

    <p>This is a simple and free way for me to generate a little buzz around the project, which I hope will get my work into the hands of more readers. It's also an accountability tool for me. If I know there are thousands of people expecting me to finish a project, I'm more likely to finish it.</p>

    <p>On the personal side of things, I get to help boost the local stats on female software engineers. I get to validate my assumption that girls are just as interested as boys in programming and gaming (and combining the two). And I get to work with some folks whose paths I may never have crossed otherwise.</p>

    <h3>OK. So, Tell Me More About The Book.</h3>

    <p>Wow. You're still reading? I expected a lot more <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDR" target="_blank">TLDR</a> responses.</p>

    <p>Sure! I'll give an overview here. If you'd like more detailed information, ping me on Twitter or Facebook. Maybe I can write blog posts with plans, roadmaps, updates, and other big-boy stuff. The landing page for the book site actually shows real-time stats on my progress and the status of each chapter, along with links to the latest text for each.</p>

    <h4><i>MonoGame: Code Camps</i></h4>

    <div style="margin-left:20px;">
    <p>In August of 2007, my game programming book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1598633686" target_blank><i>XNA Game Studio Express: Developing Games for Windows and the Xbox 360</i></a>) was published. It was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/XNA-Game-Studio-Express-Developing/product-reviews/1598633686/" target_blank>fairly well received</a>.</p>

    <p>Since 2011, I've been teaching a game programming class for teens and tweens every June in North Carolina. The class has been based on my XNA book, but <a href="" target="_blank">XNA was mothballed in 2014</a>. So, I've moved over to, and started contributing to, the open source equivalent &mdash; <a href="http://www.monogame.net/" target="_blank">MonoGame</a>.</p>

    <p>New technology? New book. This time around, I'm basing the example games on the games that my students have created over the years, with a few more that interest me thrown in.</p>

    <h3>I'm Hooked. How Do We Light A Fire Under Your Fanny?</h3>

    <p>Read. Criticize. Repeat.</p>

    <p>You can contribute directly to the GitHub repositories via pull requests for errata and suggested tweaks. If you don't know what that means, we'll figure out some other way to get editing into the hands of the readers.</p>

    <p>For <i>MonoGame: Code Camps</i>, I'm looking for game programming hobbyist and enthusiasts to do technical reviews and sanity checks. I need folks who aren't afraid of an IDE and compiler. You don't have to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack">John Carmack</a>, but some programming experience (any platform, any language) would be nice &mdash; even if it's not in game development.</p>

    <h3>How Did That Campaign Work Out for Ya?</h3>

    <p>Good question. Here's a live view of my current following on Twitter and Facebook. Feel free to like or follow. I won't stop you.</p>
