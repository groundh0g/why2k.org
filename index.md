The short version of all of this is:

* I'm working on a new game programming book, [*MonoGame: Code Camps*](http://codetopia.com/book/codecamps/).
* I'm still teaching my [annual summer camp on game programming](http://codetopia.com/camps/).
* I'm offering scholarships to two young ladies for the camp. Room, board, and tuition included. Travel to [Banner Elk, NC](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Banner+Elk,+NC+28604) not included.
* The application survey is live. Enter for a chance to win one of the two scholarships at [https://codetopia.typeform.com/to/GJfYNC](https://codetopia.typeform.com/to/GJfYNC).
* The official rules have been posted. See [the Why2K.org blog]({{ BASE_PATH }}/news/2015/12/19/scholarship-rules/) for details.

## A Note on Political Correctness

I realize that there's a strong aversion to terms like "boy" and "girl", especially when you are discussing a group of people in a given profession. This point was made with a touch of humor by Caroline Drucker in her presentation, "*How to Get More Women in Tech*". I'll let you google it. Some of her talk is very candid, open, frank, and blunt. I think it would be a bit of a tangent to dive too deeply into the topic here.

> I have a solution that could increase the number of women in tech dramatically ... If you want to be respected in tech as a woman, don't call yourself a girl....
> 
> **-- Caroline Drucker** 

I get it. In fact, I agree with it.

But, you have to understand that I'm 44 years old. I see teenagers as kids ... as boys and girls. So, I hope you'll forgive my casual use of the term "girl" here. It's not meant to be offensive or diminutive. I took great care to avoid the term "girl" in the video presentation for the scholarship. I'm taking a bit less care in this text.

I apologize in advance.

## Girl Power!

The first summer of teaching the game programming camp, in 2011, brought five students -- all male. That was the demographic that many would expect. In fact, the first year that my eldest daughter attended the camp, she pointed out that it was easy to tell which campers were taking my class. She subscribed to the same stereotypes that many of us do. Game programmers are geeky, white, male, and young.

Let's squash those stereotypes right now. Typing code on a keyboard and creating entire worlds from nothing is **NOT** the exclusive domain of young, white, geeky males. The compiler doesn't care how many X chromosomes you have. It doesn't care what your melanin levels are. It doesn't care that you have a sense of style, that you have an air of confidence, or that you have no masking tape holding your glasses together.

Every year since my first camp, there's been at least one female game-developer-to-be. In fact, as the camp has grown (to 15 students in 2015!), the ratio of female students has remained around 1-in-5. That number may seem low, but it's actually in line with the statistics for female Computer Science majors. When you consider that more than half of registered undergrads are female, though, that number seems even more anemic.

> * More than half of undergrads are female
> * Roughly half of Math and Science majors are female
> * Roughly half of gamers are female
> * Just 20% of Computer Science majors are female
> * Just 20% of my students at camp are female

I get it. Computer Science isn't for everyone. It's considered a nerdy field of study. But, females make up half of the Math and Science majors! And half of the gamers in the world are female.

While it may have been true that female gamers were a minority in the early years of gaming, current surveys show that ratio of girl-to-boy gamers is getting closer and closer to 1-to-1. When you factor in mobile gaming, casual games, and the age ranges of the players, female gamers actually outnumber their male counterparts in some surveys.

## So? What Can You Do About It?

I discussed this topic with my wife. We've decided to sponsor two girls each year for the camp I teach. So, Why2K.org now means "Why $2,000?" The answer to that question is that it's roughly the cost to me for sending two young ladies to the [game programming camp](http://codetopia.com/camps/).

I worked out a deal with the director of the camps, Greg Landry, where I forgo my pay for those students and I pay the students' room and board for the week. Factor in the fact that I have two teenage girls who attend the camp each summer, and I'm actually paying for the privilege to teach the class.

## How Can I Help?

I'm not in the begging mode just yet. I'm more than willing to put my own money and time where my heart is.

There are three, no-cost ways that you can show your support of my little experiment:

1. Share this site! Via social media, emails, phone calls, and casual conversations with folks who know young ladies who might be interested.
1. You can boost my motivation greatly with a simple [follow on twitter](https://twitter.com/groundh0g) or a [like on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Fauxcabulary).
1. You can share a link to the [new game programming book-in-progress](http://codetopia.com/book/codecamps/), too. The more folks that are watching (and waiting), the more likely I am to be shamed into making continuous progress on the project.

## How Can My Kid Qualify for the Scholarship?

I've posted the rules for the scholarship on [the Why2K.org blog]({{ BASE_PATH }}/news/2015/12/19/scholarship-rules/).

The rules are subject to change, but I don't expect that they will.

If your student meets the requirements, have them fill out the survey at [https://codetopia.typeform.com/to/GJfYNC](https://codetopia.typeform.com/to/GJfYNC). That's all you have to do to apply.

## Why Only Girls?

See the infographic I posted earlier. I don't have a shortage of male students. Statistically speaking, I don't have a shortage of female students either. As a father of three girls, I'd just like to see that girl-to-boy ratio rise a good bit.

If this experiment works out, and I feel like the students and I are getting something out of it, I'll try to expand the scope to be more inclusive in the future.

## So, What Do You Get Out Of It?

With respect to the new book, I get a little direction. I get a little motivation. Plus, I don't have to work in a vacuum.

This is a simple and free way for me to generate a little buzz around the project, which I hope will get my work into the hands of more readers. It's also an accountability tool for me. If I know there are thousands of people expecting me to finish a project, I'm more likely to finish it.

On the personal side of things, I get to help boost the local stats on female software engineers. I get to validate my assumption that girls are just as interested as boys in programming and gaming (and combining the two). And I get to work with some folks whose paths I may never have crossed otherwise.

## #Why2K, Repurposed.

The original intent of [Why2K.org](http://why2k.org/) was to boost my follower counts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/groundh0g), my likes on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Fauxcabulary/), and my fragile ego in real life. I had hoped to reach 2,000 followers on each service. That may sound ambitious, but I have friends with 10,000+ followers. Why2K.org was a catchy domain, so I randomly selected that as my goal.

The idea was simple. Total strangers would dictate what I worked on, using their likes and follows. Follow me on twitter and I would work on my new game programming book. Like my Fauxcabulary facebook page and I would work on my pun dictionary.

I took the Fauxcabulary book off the table by completing it earlier this year. I was able to generate a book with just under 470 pages by writing a program to scrape my existing and future pun-a-day blog posts. You can buy (or sample) the eBook at [LeanPub.com](https://leanpub.com/fauxcabulary), or buy a paperback version from [Lulu.com](http://www.lulu.com/shop/joseph-hall/fauxcabulary/paperback/product-22179468.html).

I'm currently focusing the lion's share of my "free time" on the new [MonoGame book](http://codetopia.com/book/codecamps/) for my summer [game programming camps](http://codetopia.com/camps/). Even though I didn't meet my goal of gaining 2,000 followers on Twitter or Facebook, I [made the decision](https://twitter.com/groundh0g/status/634589308335210497) to open the process of writing the new game programming book up for public scrutiny.

> Technically, I'm working on two books if you count my stalled novel. [Download](https://leanpub.com/revolution2dot5) the first 17 or so sample chapters if you need an effective, drug-free sleep aid.

## OK. So, Tell Me More About The Book.

Wow. You're still reading? I expected a lot more [TL;DR](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDR) responses.

Sure! I'll give an overview here. If you'd like more detailed information, ping me on Twitter or Facebook. Maybe I can write blog posts with plans, roadmaps, updates, and other grownup stuff. The landing page for the book site actually shows real-time stats on my progress and the status of each chapter, along with links to the latest text for each.

> ### *MonoGame: Code Camps*
>
> In August of 2007, my game programming book [*XNA Game Studio Express: Developing Games for Windows and the Xbox 360*](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1598633686)) was published. It was [fairly well received](http://www.amazon.com/XNA-Game-Studio-Express-Developing/product-reviews/1598633686/).
>
> Since 2011, I've been teaching a game programming class for teens and tweens every June in North Carolina. The class has been based on my XNA book, but XNA was mothballed in 2014. So, I've moved over to, and started contributing to, the open source equivalent -- [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/).
>
> New technology? New book. This time around, I'm basing the example games on the games that my students have created over the years, with a few more that interest me thrown in.

## I'm Hooked. How Do We Light A Fire Under Your Fanny?

Read. Criticize. Repeat.

You can contribute directly to [the GitHub repositories](https://github.com/groundh0g/codetopia.com/tree/gh-pages/book/codecamps) via pull requests for errata and suggested tweaks. If you aren't familiar with git repositories or how they are used, take a peek at the many tutorials out there. We'll be using GitHub in the class, so it's probably a good idea to expose yourself to those tools early.

For *MonoGame: Code Camps*, I'm looking for game programming hobbyist and enthusiasts to do technical reviews and sanity checks. I need folks who aren't afraid of an IDE and compiler. You don't have to be a [John Carmack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack), but some programming experience (any platform, any language) would be nice -- even if it's not in game development.
